There are multiple ways that Git can be used, and what is recommended depends on 1) what you do 2) How you work (alone or in a  team) 3) your own git maturity.   Git can be hard to get used to, and when you come from other systems, like TFS VC, it takes both some unlearning of old habits and some new learning of the Git ways.

We can set up 4 scenarios:

|   Scenario |   Size | Description |   Maturity |   Links |
|------|:-------:|:-------:|
| 1 | Lone developer | Working alone or alone at a given time |   All new |  [Survival Guide to Git](ASurvivalGuideToGit)|
| 2 | A small team | Two or more working at the same time    |  Beginner | [Overview of branching in Git](BranchesInGit)  ,   [Working with Git Branches](WorkingWithBranchesInGit) |
| 3 | A team | A team working actively with lots of commits and pushes | Moderate | [Rebasing in Git](RebasingInGit) |
| 4 | A team | Using pull requests and conventions on published branch naming | Experienced |  |
